Install the dependencies with npm
`npm install`

Run the application using the start script and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the application.
`npm start`

By default the app shows `star wars` movies. User input in the search bar results in movies being fetched from omdb api and results being displayed on the page.

I've created cards to display the movie search results and upon user click on a card movie details like
Cast, Plot, Writer, Genre and Release Date are displayed in a modal.
Scrolling down the page loads next bunch of movies and is appended to the existing list.
There is a slight hover effect on the cards in the search result set.

Thank You.
